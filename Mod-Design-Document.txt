**Mod/Game Design Document: Societal AI Simulator for Minecraft**

---

### **1. Overview**

**Title:** Societal AI Simulator
**Genre:** Simulation / RPG / Strategy
**Platform:** Minecraft (Forge or Fabric mod)

**Summary:**
A complex societal simulator embedded in the Minecraft world where the player and AI-driven NPCs live together in evolving societies. NPCs have ambitions, jobs, property, income, and react to player choices. The player can rise through the ranks, from a homeless citizen to a political leader or influential landowner, affecting the lives of others dynamically.

### **2. Core Gameplay Concepts**

* **NPCs With Depth:** Every NPC has:

  * A name, personality traits, profession, political views, social class, and ambitions.
  * Needs (food, shelter, income, socialization) and relationships.

* **Economic System:**

  * Currency system (e.g., Gold Coins).
  * Jobs (farmer, miner, merchant, blacksmith, guard, bureaucrat, etc.).
  * Wages, property costs, goods prices fluctuate with supply and demand.
  * Taxes based on your location and status.

* **Property Ownership:**

  * Land and buildings can be owned by players and NPCs.
  * You can rent, lease, or sell properties.
  * Owning property can grant voting rights or political power in some regions.

* **Social Mobility:**

  * Grow from homeless to wealthy citizen, property mogul, or mayor.
  * Education, reputation, and influence matter for progression.

* **Politics & Government:**

  * Different cities or countries have different systems (democracy, monarchy, oligarchy).
  * Elections, appointments, or inheritance determine leadership.
  * Policies affect taxes, jobs, security, freedoms.
  * Players can campaign, join political parties, bribe, or manipulate.

* **Dynamic Society:**

  * NPCs can lose jobs, go bankrupt, get promoted, or start businesses.
  * Crime and punishment system: theft, corruption, jailing.
  * Black markets and underground societies can emerge.

* **Countries and Regions:**

  * World is divided into multiple countries or autonomous regions.
  * Each region has its own laws, language (optional flavor), economy.
  * Trade and diplomacy between regions (wars, alliances, embargoes).

### **3. Player Mechanics**

* **Character Progression:**

  * Skills: negotiation, construction, leadership, etc.
  * Reputation: tracked separately for each faction/society.
  * Assets: money, businesses, land, influence.

* **Daily Life:**

  * Work at a job or start a business.
  * Interact with NPCs (dialogue tree system).
  * Pay taxes, upgrade home, buy/sell goods.

* **Influence Systems:**

  * Affect local economy by trade.
  * Influence NPCs through persuasion, threats, bribery.
  * Lead protests, run campaigns, propose policies.

### **4. AI Behavior Model**

* **Needs-based System:**

  * NPCs act based on needs and goals (Maslow-like hierarchy).
  * If poor, may steal or beg. If rich, may run for office.

* **Memory & Relationships:**

  * NPCs remember player actions (generosity, crimes, deals).
  * Form friendships, rivalries, grudges.

* **Social Interactions:**

  * NPCs can form families, communities, factions.
  * Rumors spread: a corrupt act may damage your reputation indirectly.

* **Autonomous Decision-Making:**

  * NPCs change jobs, migrate, revolt based on environment.
  * Factions can split or merge. Revolutions and civil wars possible.

### **5. Technical Requirements**

* **Persistent World State:**

  * Save/load data on economy, ownership, relationships.
  * Use SQLite or JSON-based system for NPC states.

* **UI Systems:**

  * HUD elements for income, reputation, influence.
  * Menus for job board, property listings, voting system.

* **Performance Considerations:**

  * Use behavior trees and LOD simulation: distant NPCs use simplified logic.
  * Dynamic chunk loading based on society centers.

---

### **6. Expansion Ideas**

* Multiplayer compatibility (players in the same society or different countries).
* Religion and cultural belief systems.
* Education, healthcare, and urban planning systems.
* Catastrophic events (economic crisis, pandemics, natural disasters).
